# Anticipated Policy Shocks

## Description

We treat the zero lower bound in our model by adding *anticipated policy shocks* and data on
the market-implied Federal Funds rate path. We do this by giving the model the
market-implied Federal Funds rate path for the next `n_anticipated_shocks` quarters and
forcing the model's interest rate path to hit those values in those quarters. Afterwards,
the path is unconstrained.  

## Implementation

If you are able to access data on the market-implied FFR path (or another form of interest
rate expectations), you can augment the sample dataset or your own dataset to enable the
anticipated policy shocks feature. We use internal data from the Federal Reserve Board on
the implied Federal Funds Rate derived from OIS quotes. (One could also use interest rate
expectations from Blue Chip Financial Forecasts or Survey of Professional Forecasters.)

1. Choose a value for `n_anticipated_shocks` (we suggest `6`):

    ```julia
    m <= Setting(:n_anticipated_shocks, 6, true, "nant", "Number of ant. pol. shocks)
    ```

2. Add implied FFR data to the `data` matrix:
    1. Append `n_anticipated_shocks` columns of `NaN` values to the end of the
       `data` matrix.
    2. Construct a matrix of data, say `ImpliedFFR`, on anticipated policy
       shocks. Define

         ```pseudocode
         For t from first quarter ZLB binds to last quarter ZLB binds
            For h from 1 quarter ahead to n_anticipated_shocks quarters ahead
                ImpliedFFR[t,h] := FFR at horizon h quarters ahead implied as of quarter t.
            End
         End
         ```

    3. Fill in the `data` matrix with the `ImpliedFFR` matrix. The first
       row of the `ImpliedFFR` matrix should go in the row of the `data` matrix in
       which the ZLB first bound and the last row of the `ImpliedFFR` matrix should
       go in the row of the `data` matrix in which the ZLB last bound.
3. With your updated input `data` matrix, the code will add the appropriate
  number of states, shocks, equilibrium condition equations, and measurement
  equations.

## Discussion

The implementation of anticipated policy shocks may not be immediately clear.
Consider the following made-up `data` matrix:

| t      | GDP  | FFR | Inf | ... | Spread | ImpFFR\_1 | ... | ImpFFR_H   |
| ------ | :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :----: | :-----:   | :-: | :--------: |
| 1960Q1 | 2.5  | 5.0 | 2.5 | ... | 1.5    | NaN       | ... | NaN        |
| 1960Q2 | 2.2  | 5.2 | 1.5 | ... | 1.3    | NaN       | ... | NaN        |
| ...    | ...  | ... | ... | ... | ...    | ...       | ... | ...        |
| 2008Q3 | 1.1  | 2.2 | 1.0 | ... | 1.5    | NaN       | ... | NaN        |
| 2008Q4 | -4.5 | 2.0 | 2.0 | ... | 1.3    | 1.0       | ... | 1.5        |
| ...    | ...  | ... | ... | ... | ...    | ...       | ... | ...        |
| 2013Q1 | 2.2  | 0.2 | 1.7 | ... | 1.7    | 0.2       | ... | 1.5        |
| 2013Q2 | 2.3  | 0.2 | 1.8 | ... | 1.6    | 0.2       | ... | 1.4        |

Interpret this as follows:

- For periods before 2008Q4, there was no forward guidance or ZLB to enforce,
  and we have no implied FFR values to enter.
- In 2008Q4, actual FFR (made-up) was 2.2. Market prices *implied* that markets
  expected an interest rate of 1.0 in 2009Q1 -- 1 period from now --
  and 1.5 `n_anticipated_shocks` periods from 2008Q4.
- In 2013Q2, actual FFR (made-up) was 0.2. Markets expected FFR to remain at 0.2
  in 2013Q3, ..., and expected FFR of 1.4 `n_anticipated_shocks` periods from
  2013Q2.
